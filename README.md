# StartFP

StartFP is an extremely minimal loader application designed to be capable of starting BlueMaxima's Flashpoint launcher using a relative path from the distributions root, while also retaining its icon when the package is copied to another machine. This is entirely to work around the rather archaic limitation of LNK files not supporting relative paths for their icons.

## Usage

Place in the root of your Flashpoint directory and use in place of the "Start Flashpoint" shortcut. Enjoy your shiny icon.
